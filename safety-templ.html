    Below are some basic safety tips to keep you safe on your hiking and backpacking journey!
</h2>

<br>

<ul class="safety-list">
    <li>Hydration: Always bring hydration on a hike or backpacking trip. Be prepared to have half to one full liter of water per hour, especially in the summer. It is always best to bring a water filtration system and double-check your water sources before a trip. </li>
   
    <li>Food: Bring a snack when hiking; you will be glad you did. While backpacking, opt for dry goods that can be rehydrated. See the backpacking page for food ideas! </li>
    
    <li>Sun Protection/Insect Protection: Avoid a painful sunburn and wear the SPF! Additionally, invest in a hat and/or uv protecting clothing. To avoid the sunscreen leaking all over your pack, pack it in its own ziplock bag or get a sunscreen stick that is solid (this tends to happen in hot weather or higher altitudes). Wear insect repellent and pack the concentrated repellent for reapplying. </li>
    
    <li>First aid: It is always best to have a small first aid kit in your day pack. For backpacking trips, it pays to invest in a premade kit bought online; these often contain everything you need along with first-aid manuals, all bundled in a lightweight package. </li>
    
    <li>Be aware: Be aware of the environment you will be in. Know the animals and insects in the area. Know the elevation and research the trail conditions before you go. It is always good practice to check for burn bans and check the weather forecast before starting any hiking trip. Do not wear headphones or earbuds while hiking, especially alone. If you do, opt to keep one ear free so you can hear animals, people, or even falling trees. </li>
    
    <li>Communicate: Tell someone where you will be or check in where appropriate. Always be sure to let friends or family know how long you will be gone and when you're expected back. </li>
    
    <li>GPS/Map: Pack a map or GPS device and have your trip planned on time. It is also a great idea to familiarize yourself with how to use a compass. </li>
    
    <li>Whistle: Bring a whistle. This can be around your neck, attached to your bag, or somewhere else handy, but it is best to be on your person. This is so if you get lost and need to signal for help. It is easier to blow a whistle than to continuously yell. </li>
        
    <li>Stranger danger: Be kind to others but do not give information away to strangers. They do not need to know where you are hiking or if youâ€™re alone. Keep those plans vague and to yourself (remember, we communicated with someone before our trip about our agenda, strangers do not count toward that communication though).</li>
    
    <li>Bury: Bury your human waste (this does not mean trash, this means your bodily waste), 6-8 inches deep and cover it with soil. Be sure you are at least 200 feet from any water or camp areas. </li>
    
    <li>Leash Laws: Check property regulations before bringing pets hiking or backpacking. Always keep your animal on a leash and pack out their waste. </li>

</ul>
