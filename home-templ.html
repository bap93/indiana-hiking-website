        Welcome to Indiana Hiking!
    </h1>
    <p>   
        Hello and welcome to Indiana Hiking, a page dedicated to hiking and backpacking in Indiana! This site recommends trails, gear, safety tips, and more from an experienced hiker/backpacker. With over 4,200 miles of trails open to the public in the state of Indiana, there are trails to meet everyoneâ€™s needs and I am excited to share some of my favorites. For more information on where to find trails, check out the hiking and backpacking pages of this site located under trails 101 in the navigation bar above.  Additionally, the resources page will help guide you to external links that will advise you on laws and regulations that are a must to know before starting your adventure. Happy Hiking and stay safe!
