    Gear

<p>
    Backpacking and hiking gear can be very expensive and a trial and error process. Below are must hav items for hiking and backpacking. Many of these items can be found at <a href="https://www.rei.com/">REI</a>. I highly suggest becoming a member if you plan on purchasing a lot, as the membership is very afforable and a one time fee (with the best return policy!!). Also, don't be afraid to buy second hand gear, REI has second hand gear that is much more afforable than new. Ebay is also a great option. I have found many quality items at thrift shops acorss the states as well.
